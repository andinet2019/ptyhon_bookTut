Python has no data declaration.
-int /int in python is float but if you want int use ground division // instead
Lists unlike tuples are mutable,values can be changed in place 
In dictionaries Keys are unique and are alwys immutable for key donot use [2,3] but (2,3)
use dictionary.get(key,None) than dictionary[key] to get value to avoid exception
sets are immutable and order is not important,non repeated
